name: "CodeQL Security Scanning"

# CodeQL is a static analysis tool that helps identify security vulnerabilities
# and code quality issues in your codebase. This workflow runs CodeQL analysis
# on the repository to detect potential security issues before they reach production.
#
# Customization Guide:
# - To analyze additional languages, add them to the language matrix below
# - Supported languages: c-cpp, csharp, go, java-kotlin, javascript-typescript, python, ruby, swift
# - For compiled languages, replace 'autobuild' step with explicit build commands
# - Adjust the schedule cron to match your preferred scanning frequency
# - Query suite can be customized in the 'Initialize CodeQL' step
